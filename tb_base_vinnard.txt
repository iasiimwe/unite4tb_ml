DESCRIPTION:
The administration is extravascular with a first order absorption (rate constant ka).
The PK model has one compartment (volume V) and a linear elimination (clearance Cl).

[LONGITUDINAL]
input = {ka, TVV, TVCl, WT}
WT = {use=regressor}

PK:
Cl = TVCl * (WT/55)^0.75
V = TVV * WT/55

; PK model definition
Cc = pkmodel(ka, V, Cl)

OUTPUT:
output = {Cc}
